    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a Creative Director, living in Las Vegas, Nevada. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to communicate with my development team without having to google everything they say and not having to awkwardly laugh when they make nerdy html jokes.</p>
    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to continue working with my current company at InfoStream Group because I like working in a startup environment that encourages their employees to further expand their knowledge and work towards growth within themselves and the business</p>
